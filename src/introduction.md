# Introduction

This book serves as a guide to Open Source contributions. It is a work in progress, and is intended to be a living document. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all things Open Source, but rather a guide to getting started with Open Source contributions.

This details my own personal workflows, and describes the tools I use on a day-to-day.

## Me

I am a software developer at freeCodeCamp. I develop course and curricula content for freeCodeCamp, and I also develop the software used to deliver the content.
