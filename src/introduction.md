# Introduction

This book serves as a guide to Open Source contributions. It is a work in progress, and is intended to be a living document. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all things Open Source, but rather a guide to getting started with Open Source contributions.

This details my own personal workflows, and describes the tools I use on a day-to-day.

## Me

I am a software developer at freeCodeCamp. I develop course and curricula content for freeCodeCamp, and I also develop the software used to deliver the content.

I develop on the whole stack - front-end and back-end. I also develop on the heap - the database. I have developed a variety of courses:

- [Rust in Replit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rust-in-replit/)
- [Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form)
- [Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-accessibility-by-building-a-quiz)
- [Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-css-transforms-by-building-a-penguin)
- [Web3 Curriculum](https://web3.freecodecamp.org/)
